Map : it alloyws you to go through each element inside of an array.
      and then you can manipulate it, change it and anything you want to do with it
      It's like foreach method.

 {this.state.recipes.map( (recipe) => {
    return <p> {recipe.titles} </p>
   }
 )};

 App.js #53)
 <p key={recipe.recipe_id}> {recipe.title} </o>
